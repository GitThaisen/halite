            <summary>
            Superclass for embedded object for use in a HalResource.
            It is abstract because you will always want to subclass this to add some actual properties.
            Subclasses should obey the HAL specification:
             - Property names are link relation types
             - Values are either a resource object or an array of resource objects.
            This means property types must be either a HalResource subclass or
            (something that implements) IEnumerable of a HalResource subclass

        <member name="T:Halite.HalLink">
            <summary>

        <member name="P:Halite.HalLink.Templated">
            <summary>
            This is not a templated link (you would use HalTemplatedLink for that). 
            Why do we return null instead of false? According to the HAL specification, 
            the value of the templated property SHOULD be considered false if it is undefined. 
            By choosing undefined over false, we avoid including the templated property 
            for non-templated links during serialization.

        <member name="T:Halite.HalLinkObject">
            <summary>
            Represents a HAL Link Object as described in the HAL specification.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Clients should never subclass this class, use HalLink or HalTemplatedLink instead.

            If the value is a URI Template then the Link Object SHOULD have a

            property is a URI Template.
